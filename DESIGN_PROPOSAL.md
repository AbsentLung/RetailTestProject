# Design Proposal

A bonus visual pass over the app, proposed before any app files change. Three concrete directions, same sample content in each so the only variable is the design itself. The rendered comparison is in the artifact; this file is the written record of what each one actually is.

No new dependencies in any of the three - hand-rolled CSS through the existing Sprockets pipeline (`app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`), consistent with this project's stance against adding a gem for something plain CSS already does.

## Option A — Quiet Ledger

A clean admin console: minimal, professional, reads like a well-made internal tool rather than a product.

- **Palette.** Cool slate-white paper (`#F6F7F9`), near-navy ink (`#1C2430`), one confident accent - a deep teal (`#146C5F`) that reads as "in stock" without reaching for literal green. Status: a muted brick red for open alerts, a muted green for resolved.
- **Type.** IBM Plex Sans for headings, Source Sans 3 for body text, IBM Plex Mono for counts and prices.
- **Layout.** A sticky top nav (Products / Stores / Brands / Alerts), content in bordered cards with soft shadows, tables sitting flush inside their card. Status shown as a small pill badge.
- **Where it fits.** Lowest risk, least opinionated of the three - the safe, correct-looking choice for a take-home submission.

## Option B — Stockroom Dashboard

More branded and warmer, like something a small retail chain's internal ops team would actually use day to day.

- **Palette.** Warm paper (`#FBF7F1`, closer to receipt stock than clinical white), warm ink-brown (`#2B2117`), a rust/amber accent (`#B5531C`) that reads as a warehouse stamp rather than a corporate blue.
- **Type.** Libre Franklin (bold, slightly condensed - a signage feel) for headings, Work Sans for body.
- **Layout.** Products/stores/brands render as a card grid instead of bare table rows - each one its own small tile. Status shown as a solid stamped chip with a dot, not a soft pill.
- **Where it fits.** More visual personality than Option A; closer to the "retail ops dashboard" category from the earlier round, now actually shown rather than named.

## Option C — Night Shift Console

Dark-mode-first, built for scanning a lot of rows fast - fitting, given the real data behind this app is 1,000,000 tracking events.

- **Palette.** Near-black charcoal-navy (`#0B0E12`), not pure black. A phosphor-green accent (`#39D98A`) for the general UI, a warm red (`#FF6B5E`) reserved for open alerts.
- **Type.** IBM Plex Mono for everything, headings included - a deliberate terminal/console feel rather than a typical CRUD-app look.
- **Layout.** Dense tables, minimal row padding. Alert status isn't a badge at all - it's a colored left-border bar on the row itself, like a log line.
- **Where it fits.** The most opinionated option. Best if the alert system (the app's actual headline feature) should visually dominate, at the cost of looking less like a conventional admin panel.

## What stays the same regardless of which one you pick

The same 4 sample products and 2 sample alerts (one ongoing, one resolved) appear in all three mockups, so the comparison is the design, not the data. Nothing in `app/` changes until one is picked - this file and the artifact are the proposal, not the implementation.

## Next step

Pick one, or name specific pieces to combine (e.g. Option A's layout with Option C's alert-row treatment). Once decided, implementation happens the same way everything else on this branch has: file by file, tested, committed with real content.
